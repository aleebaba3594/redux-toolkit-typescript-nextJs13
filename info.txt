make folder in app directory.
1) redux folder (main container)
2) store.ts
3) provider.ts
4) in redux folder make Features folder which contains all slices

app>redux>Features>counter>counter.ts
in main container means redux folder create a folder for slicemeans counterSlice etc


in next 13 everything in app directory(every component) is treated as Serever Side Component by default

redux toolkit will not work on servier side component we have to make it client side
that why we can not wrap store with provider tag 
we have to make provider seprate file means client side component and use it


--> in store.ts,provider.ts,counterSLice.ts at at the top of files write "use client" to tell that its a client side component

--> in main layout means root layout , import providers and wrap children with providers tag.

--> main page.ts means root page, we also have to make it "use client" side component.

imp--> in every component where we use redux we have to make it "client side" coz reux is not supported by server side.

--> store k andr sab slices ko import krna hy or reducer object k andr sab reducers(imported slices) ko rakh dena hy.
